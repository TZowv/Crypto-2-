What are two development environments or tool packages that can help with Ethereum smart contract development (besides Remix)? Choose one of these and setup your local environment to start using it. Include a screenshot showing your dev environment.

Truffle: Truffle is a comprehensive development framework that provides a suite of tools for compiling, deploying, testing, and managing smart contracts. It includes features such as built-in smart contract testing frameworks, 
deployment scripts, and a powerful command-line interface. Truffle also offers integration with Ganache, a personal Ethereum blockchain, allowing developers to test their contracts in a controlled environment.

Hardhat: Hardhat is a flexible Ethereum development environment that facilitates compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts. It features a local Ethereum network for testing, a built-in task runner, 
and an extensive plugin system that allows developers to extend its functionality easily. Hardhat also provides helpful tools for debugging and running tests, making it a popular choice for developers looking for a robust environment for building decentralized applications.
