Open Owner.sol in Remix. What does this contract do? Why would this be required?

Changing Ownership: The changeOwner function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address. This function is protected by the isOwner modifier, which ensures that only the current owner can call it. Additionally, it includes a check to 
prevent setting the owner to the zero address.

Retrieving Owner Information: The getOwner function is a public view function that returns the current owner's address, allowing anyone to query the owner of the contract.

Ownership Management: The contract initializes with the address of the account that deploys it as the owner. The constructor function sets the owner variable to msg.sender, 
which is the address of the account deploying the contract. An event, OwnerSet, is emitted to log the initial owner.

The Owner.sol contract is required for effective access control in decentralized applications, ensuring that only authorized users can execute specific functions. It offers flexibility by allowing 
ownership to be transferred to trusted parties or communities over time, which is essential for adapting to changing governance needs. Additionally, the contract enhances transparency and security by logging 
ownership changes through events, enabling external observers to verify the current owner, thereby fostering trust and accountability in the application.
